# Application Programming Interfaces
## APIs and Their Uses
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is set of functions, routines and tools for the use of building applications, which define the communications between another app, delivering and requesting from one another. There are numerous APIs that can help provide a programmer with the fundamentals to help develop an application. Though it varies on the definition of one, the common description of an API is that it can aid in developing programs but also provide communication between one another.
APIs are needed to help with data access and the mechanics to help make the software function. Retrieving data is key and APIs allow for this to be done as fast as possible, creating a front door to the data and can also create useable functions.

There are different APIs that can be used for various reasons, for commercial and business use other than just for a developer. Twitter APIs allows for developers to gain access to the core twitter data and to allow access to search data and trend data to interact with. YouTube API allows for the integration of YouTube videos onto websites, rather than just linking the video and can also allow for data analysis on the videos.

### Use of an API

## Relationship with SDKs
An SDK, or Software Development Kit is a kit used for creating a program, providing the user a set of tools, libraries, code samples and guides in order for developers to create the application, be it either for software framework, computers, operating systems or video game consoles.

The difference between that of APIs and SDKs is that the latter are used for the creation of applications regardless of system and purpose while APIs are only used for specific purposes but with one main purpose; communicating with other applications.
However, SDKs do include an API for the whole reason of communications between applications, so it is fairly reliant on the APIs use, using them for the functions of the application. For instance, the Java Development kit, along with the compilers and other tools, has an API which is the libraries that make up its core programming language, for the developers to use within the SDK.
